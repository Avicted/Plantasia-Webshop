# Webshop frontend

React SPA that serves the webshop for the fictional service "plantasia". At plantasia users can buy and sell flowers. Don't you just want to get rid of that old flower in the corner of your livingroom?

Or maby you want to bring some fresh CO2 eating friends into your home :)

## Libraries used

### Architectually central libraries

```bash
-   redux               # state management
-   redux-saga          # business logic implemented through generator functions
```

### Utility libraries

```bash
-   immer               # better handling of nesting of redux state updates
-   date-fns            # de-facto datetime library, moment.js is old @Note(Victor): Opinionated subjective view
-   react-router-dom    # routing...
```

### UI

```bash
-   tailwind            # utility css classes as Legoâ„¢ bricks used to build the UI
```

## Notes

This is the typical frontend setup that I have used on many projects with great success. There exists many ways to build a good frontend app, this is just one way.
